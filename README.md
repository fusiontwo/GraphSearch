# Graph Search Program with DFS, BFS, Dijkstra Algorithm

### 1. input files
- test1/input1.txt & test1/input2.txt: only one graph
- test2/input1.txt & test2/input2.txt: multiple graphs

### 2. Main Class
- Integrate DFS/BFS/Dijkstra Algorithm into one program

### 3. DFS/BFS/Dijkstra Class
- Each file contains a different algorithm implementation.
- All of these are utilized within the Main class.
